Ouster Library
========

Ouster is a library that allows users interact with sensor hardware and recorded sensor data. This is suitable for prototyping, evaluation and other non-safety critical applications using Python or C++. The C++ library has a wide range of use cases for implementing and intereacting with sensors. 

The Ouster Sensor SDK provides developers interfaces for interacting with sensor hardware and recorded sensor data suitable for prototyping, evaluation, and other non-safety-critical applications in Python and C++. Example and reference code is provided for common operations on sensor data in both languages. The SDK includes APIs for:

What you can achieve with the Library
--------

 - Querying and setting sensor configuration
 - Recording and reading data in pcap format
 - Reading and buffering sensor UDP data streams reliably
 - Conversion of raw data to range/signal/near_ir/reflectivity images (destaggering)
 - Efficient projection of range measurements to Cartesian (x, y, z) corrdinates
 - Visualization of multi-beam flash lidar data
 - Frame-based access to lidar data as numpy datatypes
 - A responsive visualizer utility for pcap and sensor
