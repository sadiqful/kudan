Description
========

Ouster is a library that allows users interact with sensor hardware and recorded sensor data. This is suitable for prototyping, evaluation and other non-safety critical applications using Python or C++. The C++ library has a wide range of use cases for implementing and intereacting with sensors while the Python library supports frame-based access to lidar data as numpy datatypes and a responsive visualizer for pcap and sensor.


What you can achieve with the Library
--------

 - Querying and setting sensor configuration
 - Recording and reading data in pcap format
 - Reading and buffering sensor UDP data streams reliably
 - Conversion of raw data to range/signal/near_ir/reflectivity images (destaggering)
 - Efficient projection of range measurements to Cartesian (x, y, z) corrdinates
 - Visualization of multi-beam flash lidar data
 - Frame-based access to lidar data as numpy datatypes
 - A responsive visualizer utility for pcap and sensor
